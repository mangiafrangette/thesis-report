Hi! My name is Francesca Mangialardo and I am a MA student in Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge at the University of Bologna, where I also earned a previous BA degree in Humanities with a thesis on computational linguistics.
Open minded and curious learner, I am studying to support the digital transformation of the cultural sector and handle the life cycle management of cultural objects.
I am also looking forward to improve the quality and the impact of language education in the society through technology and digital tools.
My thoughts and projects are driven by passion and dedication, and I am always trying to bring value to the people around me.

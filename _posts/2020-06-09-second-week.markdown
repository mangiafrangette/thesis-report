During this week I explored some tools that might be useful for my work. 
Starting from the first mainly computational activity planned in my methodology - Data retrieval, I primarily looked for Python libraries that could help me with scraping paper abstracts from their source pages. I also met Ivan so that he could teach me how to use MITAO. 

Activities
- Install and test Scrapy (includes knowing and using Anaconda, using IPython and Scrapy shell, knowing how to use CSS selectors and XPath)  
- Meeting with Ivan about MITAO
- Readings: @@@

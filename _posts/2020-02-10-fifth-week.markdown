In the previous week I clarified with my supervisor what we intend with *research paper*: only the ones that are tagged like this. It's not sustainable to make a case by case qualitative evaluation in a dataset of more than 1200 article. So with this in mind I was able to go on with the identifiers gathering from the various journals. 

# Activities
- Updating the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1glFVqvwPmhHLGnVHO9JJHkhsnmrIHqTyNqPtz3HMylY/edit#" target="_blank">document</a> that will contain the list of considered DOIs with notes about journals that will help my future self to the forthcoming data retrieval. I also explain the motives behind the DOIs selection (that are sometimes quite specific and journal dependent).
- Download and convert BibTex to JSON metadata 
  

# Questions
- Why do I need <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/" target="_blank">qraphql</a>?

# To do
- Read <a href="https://i4oa.org/#openabstracts" target="_blank"> Initiative 4 Open Abstracts</a>
- Create repository of the project 
- Define how to organize data (dois, metadata) into files for processing

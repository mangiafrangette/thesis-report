I had to spend some days installing and setting up MITAO [1] since I'm basically the first real user of the application! Thanks to the help of its loving creator I'm starting to understand how it can make my job much easier. We're still finding some issues now and then that delay my work but it should be fine. 

I also asked people about ADHO conference papers that I'm not able to find in xml. 
I will consider them in a later part of my thesis though, since time constraints are real! Now I'll keep working on the research papers.

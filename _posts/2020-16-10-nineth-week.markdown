# An extremely productive week
In this week I finally had the time to work a lot. Here the tasks I completed: 
- Harmonize metadata from other data models to my data model. Missing data are Null objects.
- Extract general metadata from websites with Scrapy and write them to my .json data model
- Extract abstracts and write them into my .json data model. 
- Duplicate all the processes made for research papers for **conference proceedings**
- Start to deal with affiliations (what a mess...)

# Issues
DSH must have blocked me, help 

# TBD
- ADHO conference proceedings
- Affiliations
- Format dates
- Decide what to do with Jahrbuch f√ºr Computerphilologie
- Scrape DSH

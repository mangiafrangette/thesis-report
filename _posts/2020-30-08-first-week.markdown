In this first week I identified the research questions, methodology and data necessary to carry out my thesis and set up some reference documents for my future work.

# Activites:
- Creation of a <a href="https://mangiafrangette.github.io/thesis-report/" target="_blank">Github page</a> to host my weekly report.   
- Creation of a <a href="https://www.protocols.io/view/a-methodology-for-extracting-and-exploring-researc-bkc5ksy6" target="_blank">protocol</a>. The protocol is not complete yet, but contains the most relevant contents to discuss with my supervisor and start the work.

Getting affiliation data is quite hard. Sometimes it looks like researchers are hiding this information not only from the readers of their articles, but from the entire web. Some journals never ever report author's institution and I had to make inferences from Google (because authors do not even have an ORCID or Research Gate account, and I'm talking about 2020 papers). 
Three journals still need a manual *scraping* for a total of 370 articles. I plan to do this in two days if my eyes can take the effort. 

# Issues

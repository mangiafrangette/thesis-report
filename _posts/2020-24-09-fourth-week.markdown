During this week I started the collection of relevant DOIs from the journals. Some theoretical issues have arisen with respect to the selection of "research articles". My thesis is not the place to try and answer the question "what makes an article a *research article*?", but nonetheless is something that I have to solve. I will have to make compromises with myself and collect the opinion of my supervisor. 

# What is *my* definition of research article? 
Some journals use the tag *Article* or *Research article* along with others: *Methods*, *Opinion*, *Case study*, *Hypothesis and theory article*... 
To some extent, all these forms of academic writing can be considered research articles, sinche they produce original research results. Being a new theory or a novel interpretation, **originality** is in fact something that the reader can give for granted: the only fact that an article is peer-reviewed should guarantee its originality!

Put aside originality, which features should be considered to discriminate? The strutcture of the article under analysis (Intro - RQ/Hypothesis - Methodology etc.) could be helpful, but unfortunately not all journals provide for articles full texts that I can read. I need features that are within the **abstract**. Which could they be?
- The clear presentation of a RQ?
- An explicit declaration of the research output (being it conceptual or concrete)? 
- Or what? 

Some examples:
- Are case studies and <a href="https://umanisticadigitale.unibo.it/article/view/8142" target="_blank">reports</a> (projects presentations) to be considered RA? (mh)
- What about <a href="https://umanisticadigitale.unibo.it/article/view/8631" target="_blank">conference proceedings</a>? (yes)
- And <a href="https://umanisticadigitale.unibo.it/article/view/9040" target="_blank">**workshop**</a> proceedings? (no)
- <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fdigh.2017.00013" target="_blank">Review articles</a>? (Not about books, reviews that present the state of the art around a certain topic) (yes)
- Opinion articles? (mh)


# Activities
- Created a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1glFVqvwPmhHLGnVHO9JJHkhsnmrIHqTyNqPtz3HMylY/edit#" target="_blank">document</a> that will contain the list of considered DOIs with notes about journals that will help my future self to the forthcoming data retrieval. I also explain the motives behind the DOIs selection (that are sometimes quite specific and journal dependent).
- Learnt how to successfully make API requests (Crossref and Datacite) with Python.  

# Questions
- Why do I need <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/" target="_blank">qraphql</a>?

# To read
- <a href="https://i4oa.org/#openabstracts" target="_blank"> Initiative 4 Open Abstracts</a>

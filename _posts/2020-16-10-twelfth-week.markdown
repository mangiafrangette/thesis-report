Time flies... I wrote a long script to fill affiliations with ROR queries results. I also tried again with pdf miner to get ADHO abstract papers but it requires more time and effort. I finally got DSH data though. 

# To do
- Normalize the affiliation “Independent scholar”
- Harmonize dates in iso standard yyyy-mm-dd

# Extraction
In this week I planned the various processes to carry out for the data extraction from both API and Scrapy. In concrete: not much has been done, but doubts were solved and in the following week I will be able to complete some tasks. 

## Task 1: Extract metadata from Crossref and Datacite
I got data from both servers: most abstracts and affiliations, absolutely necessary metadata, are missing.

## Task 2: Extract metadata from websites with Scrapy
Sometimes I need all metadata, sometimes just the abstract or the affiliations. I will figure out better in the next week how to deal with everything. 

## Task 3: Define logics and organize my working directory
I took some time to define the logics behind my algorithms and create directories and file names in a way that reflects those logics.  
Everything is on a dedicated github repository at the following link: <a href="https://github.com/mangiafrangette/MAthesis" target="_blank">https://github.com/mangiafrangette/MAthesis</a>
